# Quick config that allows a "Run To Here" functionality from inside Neovim in RADDBG.

### Setup
Install the RADDBG debugger to a desired directory from here: https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger
Inside the root folder of the raddebugger, create a launch_raddbg.bat script. I've uploaded mine which is minimal, but I created it if I wanted to add more configuration later.
